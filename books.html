        <h2>Book Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            These are some books I've read that really stuck in my mind for one reason or another.
        </p>

        <div class="books-grid">
            <div>
                <h3>The Hussite Trilogy by Andrzej Sapkowski</h3>
                <p>
                    These three books, namely "The Tower of Fools", "Warriors of God", and "Light Perpetual"
                    have some of the best character development throughout the series that I have ever come across.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i>What If?</i> by Randall Monroe</h3>
                <p>
                    The author is a cartoonist who compiled answers to questions his fans submitted.
                    Good amounts of humour and science, and planted firmly in the <i>good clean fun</i> category.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i>And All the Kings Men</i> by Gordon Stevens</h3>
                <p>
                    A look at what could have happened if Germany successfully invaded Britain
                    during the second world war. A somewhat dark speculative fiction that makes
                    a great spy thriller.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by JRR Tolkien</h3>
                <p>
                    Feels a bit clich√© to recommend it, but yep, here it is.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i>The Children of Hurin</i> by JRR Tolkien</h3>
                <p>
                    More Tolkien... Go read more Tolkien.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3><i>In Solitude's Shadow</i> by David Green</h3>
                <p>
                    A short read that got me absolutely hooked on the Empire of Ruin series.
                </p>
