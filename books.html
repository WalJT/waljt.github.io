        These are some books I've read that really stuck in my mind for one reason or another.
    </p>

    <div class="books-grid">
        <div>
            <h2>The Hussite Trilogy by Andrzej Sapkowski</h2>
            <p>
                These three books, namely "The Tower of Fools", "Warriors of God", and "Light Perpetual"
                have some of the best character development throughout the series that I have ever come across.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><i>What If?</i> by Randall Monroe</h2>
            <p>
                The author is a cartoonist who compiled answers to questions his fans submitted.
                Good amounts of humour and science, and planted firmly in the <i>good clean fun</i> category.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><i>And All the Kings Men</i> by Gordon Stevens</h2>
            <p>
                A look at what could have happened if Germany successfully invaded Britain
                during the second world war. A somewhat dark speculative fiction that makes
                a great spy thriller.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by JRR Tolkien</h2>
            <p>
                Feels a bit clich√© to recommend it, but yep, here it is.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><i>The Children of Hurin</i> by JRR Tolkien</h2>
            <p>
                More Tolkien... Go read more Tolkien.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><i>In Solitude's Shadow</i> by David Green</h2>
            <p>
                A short read that got me absolutely hooked on the Empire of Ruin series.
            </p>
