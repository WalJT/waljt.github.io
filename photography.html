            <p>
                I've set myself the lofty long term goal of taking a photo that incorporates
                every lighthouse on the island of Ireland.

                        Now unused lighthouse at Howth harbour. July 2024 <hr>
                        This photograph led to my inspiration for this project when I
                        haphazardly sent it to a friend among other photos after going for short hike.
                        When they drew my attention to the lighthouse, I began thinking about them more
                        then I had before, and realised that they could make for an interesting series of photographs.

                        Built in 1769, Balbriggan Lighthouse was in use as a sea light until the
                        construction of Rockabill Lighthouse in 1860 [<a href="https://balbrigganhistory.com/balbriggan-lighthouse/">balbrigganhistory.com</a>].

            <p>
                Three lights were constructed in the 1880s in Mornington, County Louth to
                aid vessels bound for Drogheda entering the river Boyne. These are now inactive
                since the early 2000s [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lighthouses_in_Ireland#Inactive">Wikipedia</a>].
