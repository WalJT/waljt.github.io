        <p>
            You'll find a portfolio of my most recent photos here:
            <a href="https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/waljt">https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/waljt</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in the gear and software I use and my (lack of any coherent) creative process,
            check back in a few months and there should be some ramblings on this page.

        <h3>How I got into landscape photography</h3>

        <p>
            In addition to my interest in technology, I've always been driven to the outdoors.
            A sort of harmony brought about by making coffee on a Saturday morning and spending X hours trying to get Y to work in Python,
            then realising its noon and I should probably have some breakfast,
            then spending the rest of the daylight hours trekking through woodlands.
            <br> OR <br>
            Perhaps this is some form of subconscious thriving for harmony. After spending several days staring at roughly the same 60 ish lines
            of Python code and resiting the urge to tell people that Teams not working is expected behaviour (Because <i>duh, it's Teams</i> )
            ... (Something about spending the best part of the weekend trudging through boggy forests to achieve some form of mental balance).            
        </p>
