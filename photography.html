            <h3>My journey into and around photography</h3>
            <p>
                I've found it to be a signinficant challenge to write about my photography.
                Since I treat it as an art form for self expression, meditation, and also a
                technical area with endless opprotunites for experimentation, my gear and processes
                are constantly in flux. In the two months or so since I've started writing this I've:
                <ol>
                    <li>Bought a lens I never thought I'd want</li>
                    <li>Sold a lens I initialy thought was the bees knees</li>
                    <li>Went on a trip to one of the most scenic locations in the country, and rushed taking photos to detremental effect</li>
                    <li>Dove down a huge rabbit hole of youtube videos learning how to process RAW files</li>
                    <li>Found an old camera and shot a roll of film for the first time in my life</li>
                    <li>Started experimenting with Film Simulations and more settings in my Fuji camera</li>
                    <li>Decided processing RAW files is a pain, and that I want to de-couple photography from the computer completely</li>
                </ol>

                ... So yeah... as you can probably imagine it's qute a challenge to pin down anything concrete i can
                actually write about.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my interest in technology, I've always been driven to the outdoors.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying remotely during Covid with no easily justifiable reason to ever leave the house</li>
                <li>Somehow ended up watching some youtube videos about landscape photography</li>
                <li>Bought an entry level digital camera (X-A7 + Kit Lens)</li>
                <li>Varouis hikes and stuff</li>
                <li>Photography by walking around and trying out random stuff</li>
                <li>Street photography in a crowded place is a wild rush</li>
                <li>Photos tell stories... a picture without people can feel like a stage without actors.</li>
                <li>Shooting RAW is a pain in the backside... Fuji JPEGS look fantastic</li>
            </ul>
