                If you're interested in the gear and software I use and my (lack of any coherent) creative process,
                check back in a few months and there should be some ramblings on this page.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got into Landscape photography</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to my interest in technology, I've always been driven to the outdoors.
                
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Studying remotely during Covid with no easily justifiable reason to ever leave the house</li>
                <li>Somehow ended up watching some youtube videos about landscape photography</li>
                <li>Bought an entry level digital camera (X-A7 + Kit Lens)</li>
                <li>Went for the wider kit lens and regreted it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Street photography</h3>
            <p>
                Photos tell stories... a picture without peiole can feel like a stage without actors.
            </p>

            <h3>Ramblings about my gear</h3>

            <h4>How two manual focus prime lenses made me sell my kit lens</h4>

            <h4>f/2.8 Zoom lenses and the only thing I don't like them for</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Great for landscapes, portraits, and general "Photowalking"</li>
                <li>A costly investment</li>
                <li>Street phtography with autofocus in crowds is a pain</li>
                <li>A manual prime lets me "Set and Forget" Aperture and focus</li>
                <li>I still don't have a good telephoto zoom</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The fantastic lens I don't think I'll ever buy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Viltrox 85mm f/1.8</li>
                <li>Described as "cheat mode" by the friend that leant it to me</li>
                <li>Subject is tack sharp, backround does not exists and you don't have to care</li>
            </ul>
