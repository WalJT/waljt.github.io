        <h3 id="lighthouses">The lighthouses of Ireland</h3>
        <p>
            I've set myself the lofty long term goal of taking a photo that incorporates
            every lighthouse on the island of Ireland.

        <h4>The River Boyne</h4>

        <p>
            Three lights were constructed in the 1880s in Mornington, County Louth to
            aid vessels bound for Drogheda entering the river Boyne. These are now inactive,
            having been decommissioned in the early 2000s [<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lighthouses_in_Ireland#Inactive">Wikipedia</a>]. A fourth
            light, Aleria, was constructed at the mouth of the river Boyne in 1936 and remains active[<a

        <h4>The Great South Wall, Dublin Bay</h4>
        <p>
            The Great South Wall, or South Bull Wall, is the longest sea wall in Europe to this day [<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_South_Wall">Wikipedia</a>]. Three of the lights used to guide
            ships entering
            Dublin port can be easily seen from the Great South Wall. Most notably, Poolbeg Lighthouse is situated at
            the seaward end. <br> Almost 2 kilometres from shore, the walk to Poolbeg Lighthouse takes about 25 minutes.
